    "text": "Through careful analysis of our derived data and published clinical trial results, we observed associations between drug sensitivity and the relevance of cancer biomarkers produced in the comodules. Given cancer’s aggressive and variable response across patients, identifying these biomarkers is crucial for informing treatment decisions by physicians. By refining a broader dataset of cell lines, physicians can make more informed prognostic plans that are tailored to each individual cancer type. Given the randomness of genetic variations in cancers across and within organs, correlations between biomarkers and drug sensitivity offers broader insights into how cancer cells are likely to respond to treatment.\n16 mutations were observed in comodule 2. All mutations were used in literature as biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment sensitivity, tumor progression and prognosis (7). Moreover these mutations encode proteins which will serve in DNA replication and cell communication. Saracatinib halts communication in the cell, while topotecan halts dna replication in the chromosome. Both drugs have been used in literature as a second line treatment in cancer, especially in lung cancer (3,9)."

    "section": "Purpose:",
    "text": "Purpose:\nBiomarkers are important because it may be possible for scientists to use them to detect, classify, and measure the type of cancer present in a patient. Research is ongoing to support whether or not biomarkers alone are enough to determine cancer types and potential treatments in patients. Patient data can aid in discovering the relationship between specific biomarkers, such as genes that encode proteins. These biomarkers can play an important role in discovering how treatments can be applied to specific cancer types. Our work continues with results obtained in a Master’s thesis by Sheena Mogan titled “Biomarker Discovery by Semi-Supervised Non-Negative Matrix Factorization”. Our goal is to apply Non-Negative Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (NNCPD) to the datasets used in her research and compare our results to her findings. Furthermore, we will confirm the links between the genetic information and cancer types found by NNCPD in the datasets in comparison to the results that have been confirmed in the peer-reviewed publications. We chose NNCPD because of its ability to process multi-omics data tensors, unlike other algorithms limited by their inability to analyze data in more than two dimensions. We hope this method of analyzing genetic oncological data will provide oncologists with a wider lens regarding patient cancer types and possible outcomes of treatment."

Our results eliminate the need to analyze each data frame separately by stacking them into a single tensor before applying Non-negative Canonical Polyadic Decomposition. \\[\nLatex format section\n\\]\n\n# TODO\n# Figure out how to list modules in index in the order you decide rather than just in alphabetical order (which is the default)"
